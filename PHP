$ Result = ' ' ; $ len = mb_strlen ( $ STR ); for ( $ I = $ len - . 1 ; $ I > = 0 ; $ I - - ){ $result .= mb_substr ( $str , $i , 1 , $encoding );         } return $result ;

Function  swap ( int  & $a , int  & $b ){

Mysql
The difference between Myisam and innodb
Storage structure. Myisam one table, three files. Structure, data, index

Innodb two files. The index and data are kept in one file.

Innodb supports transactions, myiam does not support

Innodb supports foreign keys and supports row locks

Method of optimizing the database
Choose the right storage engine
Choose the appropriate table field type
Appropriate increase of index
Increase server hardware
Sub-database
Read and write separation
Database transaction

REDIS
Memcache The product itself is especially the storage of data in the memory. If the server suddenly loses power, all the data will be lost. The data stored in a single key (variable) has a limit of 1M. The type of data stored is String string type itself is not persistent. The function can use multi-core (multi-threading) Redis data types are more abundant: String, List, Set, Sortedset, Hash have persistence function, can store data on disk at any time, it has certain calculation function, a single key (variable) is stored. Data has a 1GB limit
