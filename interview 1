1. Give you four coordinate points and judge whether they can form a rectangle. For example, the judgment ([0,0],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0]) can form a rectangle.

Solution ideas:

Take a point as a reference point. Calculate the distance to any three points, one point of the longest distance is the diagonal point.

The remaining two points are the left and right points. Use the remaining two points to calculate the distance of the other diagonal. If the two diagonals are equal,

Determine if any of the corners is a right angle. You can tell if it is a rectangle.

3, write a function, get all the pictures in the content of an article, and download

function  catchData ( $ URL ) { 
$ String = file_get_contents ( $ URL ); preg_match_all ( '/ < \ S * IMG [^ the src] * the src \ S * = \ S * "( [^"] * ) " /' , $string , $data ); $imgs = $data [ 1 ]; if ( empty ( $imgs )) { return false ;     }      
    
      
    
         

    the foreach ( $ imgs  AS  $ Key => $ value ) { 
$ path = the explode ( " / " , $ value ); echo $ value ; $ IMG = file_get_contents ( $ value ); file_put_contents ( $ path [ COUNT ( $ path ) - 1 ], $img );     } }          
         
          
        

4. Obtain the IP address of the current client and determine whether it is (111.111.111.111, 222.222.222.222)

Note: (111.111.111.111, 222.222.222.222) This is a collection interval, not an array of arrays

Use php to get the ip address. Then turn into long

Public  function  ip () { 
// strcasecmp compares two characters, not case sensitive. Returns 0, >0, <0. If ( getenv ( ' HTTP_CLIENT_IP ' ) && strcasecmp ( getenv ( ' HTTP_CLIENT_IP ' ), ' unknown ' )) { $ip = getenv ( ' HTTP_CLIENT_IP ' );     } elseif ( getenv ( ' HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR ' ) && strcasecmp ( getenv    
     
          
 ( ' HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR ' ), ' unknown ' )) { 
$ip = getenv ( ' HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR ' );     } elseif ( getenv ( ' REMOTE_ADDR ' ) && strcasecmp ( getenv ( ' REMOTE_ADDR ' ), ' unknown ' )) { $ip = Getenv ( ' REMOTE_ADDR ' );     } elseif (          
 
          
Isset ( $_SERVER [ ' REMOTE_ADDR ' ]) &&  $_SERVER [ ' REMOTE_ADDR ' ] &&  strcasecmp ( $_SERVER [ ' REMOTE_ADDR ' ], ' unknown ' )) { 
$ip = $_SERVER [ ' REMOTE_ADDR ' ];     } $res = Preg_match ( '/ [ \d\. ] {7,15} /' , $ip , $matches          

       ?) $ The matches [ 0 ]: ' ' ; 
return $ IP ; } $ IP = sprintf ( ' % U ' , ip2long (IP ()); $ the begin = sprintf ( ' % U ' , ip2long ( ' 111.111.111.111 ' )) $end = sprintf ( ' %u ' , ip2long ( ' 222.222.222.222 ' )) if ( $ip     

  
  
  
 >  $begin  &&  $ip  <  $end ) { 
echo " in this interval " . }

9, two intersecting singly linked lists, how to find their first common node

Idea:

1. If the two linked lists intersect, starting from the intersection point, the following nodes are the same, that is, the last node must be the same;

2. Traverse the two linked lists from beginning to end, and record the length of the linked list. When the tail nodes of the two are different, the two must not intersect;

3. The tail nodes are the same. If A is LA and B is LB, if LA>LB, then LA before LA is skipped.

Class  Node { 
public $data = NULL ; public $next ; }     
   


function  getNodeLength ( the Node  $ Node ) { 
IF ( empty ( $ Node )) return 0 ; $ length = 0 ; the while ( $ Node ! = NULL ) { $ lenght ++ ;   } return $ length ; } / ** * seeking two The first public node that the single linked list intersects */ function getPoint ( Node $a , Node $b ) { $a_length = getNodeLength( $a   
     
    
    

   



 
   
   ); 
$ B_length = getNodeLenght ( $ B ); // exchange lists two IF ( $ a_lenght < $ b_lenght ) { $ TEMP = $ A ; $ A = $ B ; $ B = $ TEMP ;   } $ STEP = ABS ( $a_length - $b_length ); // Let a go step for ( $i = 0 ; $i < $step ; $i ++ ) { $a = $a   
  
    
      
      
      

      
  
    
      -> next ; 
  } 
// Synchronize while ( $a && $a ! == $b ) { $a = $a -> next ; $b = $b -> next ;   } return $a ; }

21, the parameter is an array of multiple date and time, returning the time closest to the current time

Problem-solving ideas: Let the first time be a sentinel. Calculate the difference diff between the first time and the current time, and then traverse from the second value. If the value of the second value and the current time is greater than diff. Then continue, otherwise the time is close to the current time. Assign min to the current value.

function ( $ timeArray , $ now ) { 
$ min = $ timeArray [ 0 ]; $ the diff = ABS ( $ min - $ now ); $ length = COUNT ( $ timeArray ); for ( $ I = . 1 ; $ I < $ length ; $ I ++ ) { $ DIFF1 = $ timeArray [ $ I ] - $ now ; IF ( $ DIFF1 < $ the diff      
     
      
    
           
          ) { 
$diff = $diff1 ; $min = timeArray [ $i ];         }     } return $min ; }

105. When the TCP connection is disconnected, the timewait state will appear at the end of the split or the end of the breakup.

Appears at the end of the breakup. Time_wait will last 2mls. Due to network instability and other factors, ack transmission failure will result. Within 2MLS, it can be resent.

The party that passively closes the connection does not receive the ACK acknowledgement packet of the other party for a period of time, and will resend the FIN packet. Therefore, the party that actively closes the connection needs to stay in the waiting state to process the FIN packet resent by the other party. Otherwise he will respond to a RST packet to the party that passively closes the connection, making the other party inexplicable.

In the TIME_WAIT state, the application is not allowed to establish a new connection on the current ip and port with the client that communicated before (the client's ip and port number are unchanged). This will prevent new connections from receiving packets from the network before the previous ip and port connections are consistent. This is also why the TIME_WAIT state wait time is set to 2MSL to ensure that all TCP packets that have not been received in the current direction on the network have all disappeared.
